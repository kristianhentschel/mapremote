mapremote
=========
A tool to control a map representation on a presentation screen from a mobile device. Works best in Chrome/Chrome for Android. Think of it as Chromecast but for Google Maps rather than Netflix. (Chromecast may or may not support similar functionality).

Uses node.js with socket.io and the Google Maps Javascript API.

Using mapremote
---------------
On any computer on a network accessible from both your presentation laptop and your remote control mobile device (e.g. any computer, including the one you present from, on your WiFi), you need to install [node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/download/). This will be your server. Place server.js, index.html, package.json from this repository in any folder on your server computer. Open a command line, change to this folder, and run `npm install`. This will download any dependency packages. To start the server, type `node server.js`. The server will run on the default HTTP port (80), so you cannot run a web server on the same machine at the same time.

Open a web browser on both the presentation screen and your mobile device and navigate both to the IP of your server computer. On your remote, type the numerical pin code displayed on the screen computer, and hit Enter/Go on the keyboard. Both screens should display a map.

On your mobile device, drag and drop to move the map, use the pinch gesture (or scroll wheel on a laptop) to zoom, and click the map to place a marker. All these changes will be reflected on the big screen.

Caveats
-------
* You need to have a server with node.js and npm installed, and know the IP address of this server. I just use my laptop, but it does not have to be on your local network.
* The map position on the host screen can only be updated at the end of a scrolling motion. This seems to be a limitation of the Google Maps Javascript API for mobile devices.
* Google displays icons and labels for points of interest. If you try to place a marker on top of such a label, the click event will be caught by the label and Google will display an info window about that POI on your mobile device. There seems to be no easy way to disable this behaviour without also removing all POI labels.
